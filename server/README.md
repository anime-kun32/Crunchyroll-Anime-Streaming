# Crunchyroll Anime/Video Streaming - Server

This is the high-performance backend for the Crunchyroll CMS, built using **NestJS**. It handles **HLS media transcoding and concurrent uploads using Kafka**, ensuring **optimized video streaming and content management**. The backend is fully independent from the client and designed for **high throughput and scalable performance**.

It supports **automatic API retry mechanisms** to handle failures and uses **promise pooling** for **efficient concurrent uploads**. Both **media transcoding and file uploads are managed asynchronously with Kafka**, improving performance and scalability. Static assets are stored in **Supabaseâ€™s S3-compatible bucket**, while **MongoDB** serves as the database.

### ðŸ”¥ Tech Stack:
- **Node.js** + **NestJS** â€“ Scalable, modular backend.
- **TypeScript** â€“ Type-safe, maintainable code.
- **FFmpeg** â€“ Handles HLS media transcoding.
- **Kafka** â€“ Manages **both file uploads and transcoding** asynchronously.
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for content management.
- **Supabase (S3 Bucket)** â€“ Cloud storage for static assets.

### ðŸš€ Features:
- **HLS Media Transcoding** â€“ Converts videos into HLS segments for streaming.
- **Kafka-Powered Processing** â€“ **Handles both uploads and transcoding** asynchronously.
- **Concurrent Uploads** â€“ Uses **promise pooling** for optimized speed.
- **Auto-Retry API Requests** â€“ Ensures API reliability in case of failures.
