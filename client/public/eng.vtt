00:16.370 --> 00:18.164
Captain, we should support them too.

00:18.748 --> 00:20.458
You know it's futile, don't you?

00:21.208 --> 00:25.421
Our conventional weapons
can't harm those things.

00:27.089 --> 00:31.510
We can only leave it to those hunters.

00:48.277 --> 00:49.737
Engage individually!

00:49.820 --> 00:52.823
If this place is breached,
our lines will collapse!

00:54.325 --> 00:55.159
Don't retreat!

01:08.756 --> 01:10.466
No. I can't.

01:10.549 --> 01:13.177
This isn't an opponent we can handle.

01:14.428 --> 01:15.721
Damn it.

01:16.222 --> 01:18.516
I'm about to lose consciousness...

01:29.109 --> 01:30.486
Is it healing magic?

01:33.030 --> 01:34.114
Incredible.

01:34.198 --> 01:35.533
My wound healed in an instant.

01:36.492 --> 01:38.160
Look... Look out!

01:38.244 --> 01:39.620
Byung-gu, get down!

01:41.747 --> 01:42.998
Yoonho!

01:43.082 --> 01:43.916
Leave it to me.

01:56.011 --> 01:57.638
S-rank hunters.

01:57.721 --> 01:59.640
S-rank hunters are here.

01:59.723 --> 02:02.101
You're too far ahead, Byung-gu.

02:02.184 --> 02:03.477
I'm sorry.

02:03.561 --> 02:05.354
I wanted to save more people.

02:05.437 --> 02:09.316
Moreover, I believe
that you two will protect me.

02:17.324 --> 02:20.452
It doesn't look like the boss.

02:20.536 --> 02:22.955
It must be the leader of these monsters.

02:23.622 --> 02:25.541
Byung-gu, take care of the wounded.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.043
Leave it to me, Yoonho.

02:28.544 --> 02:30.171
Let's go, Eunseok!

02:30.254 --> 02:31.088
Understood.

02:52.651 --> 02:53.569
Take this!

03:01.785 --> 03:03.037
You brute.

03:03.120 --> 03:03.954
What?

03:07.082 --> 03:09.376
It doesn't seem to be the leader either.

03:09.460 --> 03:11.337
Interesting.

03:24.099 --> 03:27.186
Looks like they made it in time.

03:30.731 --> 03:31.649
Well then,

03:31.732 --> 03:33.233
let's begin.

03:34.193 --> 03:36.153
Mr. Choi, we're ready.

03:36.237 --> 03:37.071
All right.

03:51.001 --> 03:52.836
Let's attack now!

03:58.759 --> 04:00.844
More than a decade ago,

04:00.928 --> 04:03.264
portals that could connect
to a different dimension

04:03.347 --> 04:06.392
suddenly appeared in the world.

04:07.142 --> 04:12.022
Various monsters and magic beasts
reside within the portal.

04:12.106 --> 04:14.358
Conventional weapons can't fight them.

04:14.441 --> 04:18.070
Only those with awakened
special abilities are able to fight them.

04:18.654 --> 04:20.155
They are called hunters.

04:20.823 --> 04:23.909
Based on their magical powers,

04:23.993 --> 04:31.000
hunters are classified
as ones of S, A, B, C, D, E and rank.

04:32.543 --> 04:37.089
However, once awakened,
no matter how hard they try,

04:38.048 --> 04:40.884
their abilities will
no longer be developed.

05:04.533 --> 05:06.577
Good luck with today's raid mission.

05:06.660 --> 05:07.578
Thank you.

05:08.662 --> 05:10.456
Hey, Kim.

05:10.956 --> 05:12.750
- Long time no see.
- What?

05:13.584 --> 05:15.210
Park? What brings you here?

05:15.794 --> 05:18.213
I thought you quit being a hunter.

05:19.798 --> 05:21.675
My wife is pregnant with our second child.

05:21.759 --> 05:23.093
I see.

05:23.177 --> 05:26.138
We can make a lot of money
if the raid mission is successful.

05:27.181 --> 05:28.557
But I'm very worried.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.477
I don't know if I can keep up
with you all after my hiatus.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.354
I'm not very strong as well.

05:33.437 --> 05:35.773
Is that Sung?

05:35.856 --> 05:37.733
Good morning, Sung.

05:37.816 --> 05:39.651
It must be tough in cold weather.

05:41.904 --> 05:43.530
Nice to see you today.

05:43.614 --> 05:45.491
Hey, Sung.

05:45.991 --> 05:47.659
Have you been eating properly?

05:48.202 --> 05:50.704
Yes. I have been eating properly.

05:51.330 --> 05:53.665
Who is he? Is he strong?

05:53.749 --> 05:55.501
Why is everyone greeting him?

05:56.794 --> 05:58.003
It's actually the opposite.

05:58.087 --> 06:00.422
He joined us after you left.

06:00.506 --> 06:04.968
That kid has a nickname,
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

06:05.052 --> 06:07.471
The weakest? Not the strongest?

06:07.554 --> 06:08.388
The weakest.

06:08.472 --> 06:11.266
He was even injured
in an E-rank dungeon and hospitalized.

06:11.892 --> 06:14.394
He's probably the weakest hunter.

06:14.478 --> 06:16.772
Really? He's that weak?

06:16.855 --> 06:21.068
So, calling that kid here
means this mission is easy.

06:21.151 --> 06:22.611
I see.

06:22.694 --> 06:23.987
Don't let him hear this.

06:24.071 --> 06:26.365
Let's end this topic.

06:27.074 --> 06:29.243
I heard everything.

06:29.743 --> 06:30.786
But,

06:30.869 --> 06:33.914
what he said is true. I can't deny it.

06:33.997 --> 06:36.416
Jinwoo, why are you injured again?

06:36.917 --> 06:38.418
Joohee.

06:38.502 --> 06:40.170
We're going on a mission together again.

06:40.838 --> 06:43.882
More importantly,
what happened to your face?

06:43.966 --> 06:46.718
Well... Just the usual.

06:48.095 --> 06:50.305
Be more careful.

06:51.598 --> 06:53.809
I heard you ended up in the hospital.

06:53.892 --> 06:56.270
I was the only one that got injured
in the E-rank dungeon.

06:56.353 --> 06:58.564
There was no healer in your team?

06:59.148 --> 07:03.777
The others are all high-ranked hunters,
so they didn't need a healer.

07:03.861 --> 07:05.362
How could they?

07:05.445 --> 07:07.781
There could be other people who need one.

07:07.865 --> 07:10.284
It's okay. I'm just too weak.

07:10.784 --> 07:13.203
You must know this too.

07:13.704 --> 07:15.080
I'm already used to it.

07:17.249 --> 07:19.251
Looks like we're about to go in.

07:19.334 --> 07:20.210
Let's go.

07:21.753 --> 07:25.799
I would like to propose that
I'll be the captain of this raid mission.

07:25.883 --> 07:26.884
My name is Song Chiyul.

07:27.509 --> 07:29.011
Nice to meet you all.

07:29.094 --> 07:30.888
Of course.

07:30.971 --> 07:34.016
You are the highest-ranked
hunter among us.

07:34.099 --> 07:35.726
I'm relieved to have you lead the team.

07:36.393 --> 07:38.520
Nice to meet you, Mr. Song.

07:38.604 --> 07:39.438
All right.

07:40.022 --> 07:42.024
Is everyone ready?

07:42.107 --> 07:42.941
Let's go in.

07:48.614 --> 07:49.448
Sung.

07:51.074 --> 07:53.785
Stick close to us and don't get hurt.

07:55.162 --> 07:55.996
Okay.

07:56.079 --> 07:57.998
Let's do our job well.

08:01.335 --> 08:03.795
A small knife with little magic power.

08:05.005 --> 08:07.966
With my income,
I can only afford this knife.

08:08.592 --> 08:09.885
But it's better than nothing.

08:13.222 --> 08:15.015
I must perform well today.

08:24.316 --> 08:26.610
Thank you for your hard work,
President Go.

08:27.110 --> 08:29.363
How was your meeting with the government?

08:30.113 --> 08:32.783
They always say the same thing.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.785
They want us to avoid Dungeon Break.

08:34.868 --> 08:38.997
And they demand us to stably supply
the goods acquired from the dungeon.

08:40.290 --> 08:43.919
There's nothing wrong with their requests.

08:44.002 --> 08:49.258
We make a living by reselling goods
acquired from the dungeon.

08:54.263 --> 08:57.558
The crystals obtained
from slain magic beasts

08:57.641 --> 08:59.560
are known as the magic gems.

08:59.643 --> 09:00.769
They can be sold for money.

09:07.359 --> 09:08.318
I did it.

09:08.902 --> 09:10.487
I finally got the first...

09:10.571 --> 09:11.446
Jinwoo!

09:26.044 --> 09:27.337
Jinwoo!

09:27.421 --> 09:28.672
Joohee, back off.

09:28.755 --> 09:29.590
Take this!

09:33.677 --> 09:35.470
I'll defeat the next magic beast.

09:36.054 --> 09:37.431
Joohee, you go heal Sung.

09:38.265 --> 09:39.141
Okay!

09:41.351 --> 09:42.519
It's fine.

09:43.103 --> 09:44.771
I'll definitely heal you.

10:01.371 --> 10:05.459
The magic gems obtained
from high-rank magic beasts

10:05.542 --> 10:11.298
can be made into more powerful weapons
to defeat stronger magic beasts.

10:11.798 --> 10:16.345
Although the mana crystals harvested
from the dungeon can also be weapons,

10:16.428 --> 10:18.555
their effects are not as good
as those of magic gems.

10:19.056 --> 10:21.767
But the requirement of the government...

10:22.643 --> 10:25.103
They want to use them
as a new type of energy.

10:26.021 --> 10:28.106
It is safer than nuclear power,

10:28.190 --> 10:31.318
and more efficient than hydropower,
wind power, and geothermal power.

10:31.401 --> 10:34.071
It causes less air pollution
than thermal power.

10:34.988 --> 10:37.240
So, it's the ideal green energy.

10:37.741 --> 10:40.202
The government is researching
how to generate electricity

10:40.285 --> 10:42.496
using magic gems and mana crystals.

10:42.579 --> 10:45.457
It can only be realized through
rare resources acquired by hunters.

10:46.166 --> 10:49.711
Therefore, the hunters are
particularly important.

10:56.843 --> 10:58.303
- Great!
- We did it!

10:58.387 --> 11:00.013
We defeated the dungeon boss.

11:00.097 --> 11:02.015
- Nice!
- Mr. Song really is amazing.

11:02.099 --> 11:03.600
- We succeeded.
- Yeah!

11:04.685 --> 11:05.686
Jinwoo.

11:05.769 --> 11:08.855
Did you choose
to be a hunter out of pique?

11:09.981 --> 11:13.610
Something will happen to you someday.

11:13.693 --> 11:17.030
Not only your stomach, your whole body
will sustain significant injury.

11:17.114 --> 11:17.948
I'm sorry.

11:18.031 --> 11:20.367
I don't want an apology.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.160
I'm worried about you.

11:27.874 --> 11:31.002
Everyone, did you get your spoils?

11:31.086 --> 11:33.588
We got most of them.

11:33.672 --> 11:36.007
There aren't many mana crystal veins here.

11:36.091 --> 11:39.052
We can't make much money.

11:40.178 --> 11:41.721
Is it over?

11:42.806 --> 11:46.184
I only got this E-rank magic gem.

11:47.436 --> 11:49.896
It's not worth risking my life for this.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.233
Hey!

11:53.316 --> 11:54.985
Everyone, come over here!

11:55.944 --> 11:56.778
Is it a cave?

11:56.862 --> 11:57.988
Or a tunnel?

11:58.071 --> 12:00.449
It seems that the cave is quite deep.

12:00.532 --> 12:02.868
A double dungeon?

12:02.951 --> 12:04.870
I've heard of it.

12:04.953 --> 12:08.915
After all, we have defeated the boss,
but the dungeon is not closing.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.293
Right, I find it odd too.

12:11.376 --> 12:12.794
So, it means...

12:12.878 --> 12:13.920
Right.

12:14.004 --> 12:16.256
There are more quarries
deep within this cave.

12:16.339 --> 12:18.216
Listen to me.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.136
Usually, in such a situation,

12:21.219 --> 12:24.681
we should report to Hunters Association
and follow instructions.

12:24.764 --> 12:26.725
Wait a minute, Song.

12:26.808 --> 12:30.187
Doesn't that mean giving up quarries
to the hunters coming after us?

12:30.270 --> 12:34.191
It's just a D-rank dungeon. It's okay.

12:34.274 --> 12:36.276
His wife is pregnant
with their second child,

12:36.359 --> 12:38.153
and there are so few mana crystals here.

12:38.737 --> 12:41.448
It should be okay to give some slack,

12:41.531 --> 12:42.782
right?

12:42.866 --> 12:44.659
I can understand how you feel.

12:44.743 --> 12:46.995
But it's also true that
there are unknown dangers.

12:47.621 --> 12:48.747
Let's vote on it.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.123
I don't want to go.

12:50.207 --> 12:51.166
Let's go.

12:51.249 --> 12:52.459
I object.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.376
Object.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.504
- Let's go check it out.
- I feel the same.

12:55.587 --> 12:57.297
- Right.
- We should go back.

12:57.797 --> 13:00.050
- I'm going.
- Of course, I will go.

13:00.133 --> 13:03.011
Sorry... I don't want to go.

13:04.262 --> 13:06.765
It's 6 votes in favor
and 6 votes against it.

13:07.307 --> 13:10.018
Only Sung hasn't voted. What do you think?

13:10.101 --> 13:11.478
I...

13:13.104 --> 13:17.108
I understand how dangerous
a D-rank dungeon is for me.

13:18.151 --> 13:19.152
But...

13:19.236 --> 13:21.029
With my father missing,

13:21.112 --> 13:23.114
I'm the only one
in the family who can earn money.

13:24.115 --> 13:25.325
My mother has medical expenses.

13:25.408 --> 13:27.619
My sister has to go to college.

13:28.828 --> 13:31.081
So, I need money.

13:32.624 --> 13:33.583
I'm going.

13:40.465 --> 13:43.635
Then please place your hand
on the black crystal.

13:50.725 --> 13:52.561
Next one, please.

13:56.273 --> 13:57.941
Are you a C-rank hunter?

13:58.024 --> 13:59.526
Then please join our association.

13:59.609 --> 14:02.737
These are the contract terms
of our association.

14:02.821 --> 14:04.739
Here are descriptions of work conditions.

14:07.867 --> 14:13.164
Right, one B-rank hunter and two C-rank
hunters have agreed to sign with us.

14:13.748 --> 14:16.126
Everything is going smoothly, Mr. Choi.

14:16.209 --> 14:17.627
Very good.

14:17.711 --> 14:19.713
Regardless of gender or age,

14:19.796 --> 14:22.340
recruit anyone with talent.

14:22.966 --> 14:28.305
But I don't think any talent is stronger
than Cha Hae-In of our association.

14:30.348 --> 14:31.600
Someone catch them!

14:32.225 --> 14:33.435
Move...

14:37.814 --> 14:40.066
Move! Do you want to get hit?

15:02.297 --> 15:03.965
- I...
- Here it is.

15:04.841 --> 15:05.926
Thank you!

15:06.009 --> 15:07.385
- It's Cha Hae-In!
- Thank you!

15:07.469 --> 15:08.428
Cha Hae-In!

15:08.511 --> 15:09.429
That S-rank hunter?

15:09.512 --> 15:11.389
- Awesome!
- It's her!

15:11.473 --> 15:12.557
So cute.

15:12.641 --> 15:13.934
- I'm your fan.
- I...

15:14.017 --> 15:15.352
- Can you shake my hand?
- I...

15:21.608 --> 15:22.609
Amazing!

15:22.692 --> 15:24.486
That's an S-rank hunter's ability.

15:27.405 --> 15:29.824
How long have we been walking
after entering the cave?

15:29.908 --> 15:31.701
About 40 minutes.

15:31.785 --> 15:34.537
The portal will close in an hour
after the boss is defeated.

15:34.621 --> 15:36.039
So we have 20 minutes.

15:36.539 --> 15:38.959
I'm sorry.

15:39.042 --> 15:40.543
Why are you apologizing?

15:40.627 --> 15:44.589
My vote forced you to come in too.

15:44.673 --> 15:46.591
I'm okay.

15:46.675 --> 15:47.926
Don't worry.

15:48.009 --> 15:50.637
Are you really okay?

15:51.304 --> 15:52.389
How could I possibly

15:52.472 --> 15:54.224
be okay?!

15:54.307 --> 15:56.351
Did you forget?

15:56.434 --> 16:00.438
Jinwoo, if you had been stabbed
a little higher, you would have died.

16:00.522 --> 16:03.692
And I barely managed
to heal your hands and feet.

16:03.775 --> 16:05.777
Are you crazy?

16:05.860 --> 16:07.570
Are you out of your mind?

16:07.654 --> 16:08.738
Tell me.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.657
I'm sorry.

16:11.241 --> 16:12.242
That's right.

16:12.325 --> 16:16.121
Thanks to the B-rank healer Joohee,
I was able to survive every time.

16:16.204 --> 16:18.748
Are you truly reflecting?

16:18.832 --> 16:19.666
Yes.

16:21.501 --> 16:25.588
Well, you can apologize
by treating me to a meal next time.

16:25.672 --> 16:26.548
What?

16:26.631 --> 16:30.468
What? You don't like eating with me?

16:30.552 --> 16:32.554
No... How could that be?

16:32.637 --> 16:33.596
We've arrived.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.015
It's the boss room.

16:37.809 --> 16:40.770
It's rare to see rooms
with doors like this.

16:40.854 --> 16:42.439
It feels a bit weird.

16:42.522 --> 16:43.690
Right.

16:43.773 --> 16:44.941
I'm going in.

16:45.025 --> 16:46.860
I can't go back empty-handed.

16:46.943 --> 16:48.528
That's right. I'm going too.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.614
We shall advance and retreat together.

16:51.698 --> 16:54.325
Is that right, Captain Song?

16:55.410 --> 16:56.745
Right.

17:00.874 --> 17:03.001
Hello, everyone.

17:03.084 --> 17:06.546
I'm Go Gunhee, the president
of the Hunters Association.

17:06.629 --> 17:08.173
I suppose some among you

17:08.256 --> 17:13.428
will become hunters in the future,
while others will not.

17:13.511 --> 17:16.181
The portal has existed
for more than ten years.

17:16.264 --> 17:19.142
There are still many mysteries
unsolved in the dungeon.

17:19.225 --> 17:21.394
Being a hunter is
a life-threatening profession.

17:21.478 --> 17:23.521
Even if you've gotten
used to raid missions,

17:23.605 --> 17:25.523
you can't let your guard down.

17:25.607 --> 17:28.318
Don't be arrogant and contemptuous.

17:28.401 --> 17:30.361
If you want to survive,
there's only one key point.

17:30.445 --> 17:32.822
That is to be more cautious.

17:41.122 --> 17:42.290
The fire started.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.292
Nice atmosphere.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.503
This is my first time
visiting this kind of dungeon.

17:55.678 --> 17:57.680
What's going on with these statues?

17:57.764 --> 17:59.265
They seem to be century-old ones.

17:59.808 --> 18:01.518
Some of them are holding
musical instruments.

18:07.774 --> 18:09.484
Only this statue is particularly large.

18:10.485 --> 18:11.903
It is indeed very large.

18:11.986 --> 18:12.904
What is this?

18:12.987 --> 18:14.364
It feels quite eerie.

18:14.989 --> 18:17.450
Speaking of which,
where is the magic beast?

18:17.534 --> 18:18.409
That's right.

18:18.493 --> 18:20.078
There's not a single one.

18:21.913 --> 18:24.082
What is this? A magic circle?

18:24.165 --> 18:26.709
Mr. Song, something is written here!

18:27.794 --> 18:29.087
Is this ancient language?

18:29.170 --> 18:30.171
Let me see.

18:30.964 --> 18:33.591
"The Commandments of the Cartenon Temple."

18:33.675 --> 18:36.594
"First, worship the God."

18:36.678 --> 18:39.556
-"Second, praise the God."
- Jinwoo...

18:40.390 --> 18:42.267
"Third, believe in God..."

18:42.350 --> 18:46.688
The eyes of that large statue just moved.

18:47.355 --> 18:49.357
It was looking at us.

18:49.899 --> 18:50.733
What?

18:50.817 --> 18:54.320
-"Those who do not obey..."
- How can it? You saw it wrong.

18:55.155 --> 18:57.031
"...will not be able
to leave this place alive."

19:01.494 --> 19:03.204
Look. The door is closed.

19:03.288 --> 19:05.206
What? How come?

19:05.290 --> 19:07.876
Are we trapped here?

19:09.169 --> 19:10.920
That's why I didn't want to come!

19:11.004 --> 19:13.006
This happened because
you underestimated the dungeon!

19:13.631 --> 19:15.800
We never should have
come here in the first place.

19:15.884 --> 19:16.718
I'm going back.

19:17.343 --> 19:20.054
You guys can have all the treasures.

19:20.597 --> 19:21.681
Goodbye.

19:22.932 --> 19:24.392
Get out of there!

19:41.534 --> 19:43.411
No!

19:43.494 --> 19:44.913
- No way.
- It moved!

19:45.705 --> 19:47.999
Are we going to fight that?

19:49.834 --> 19:52.253
What is the rank
of the person who just got killed?

19:52.337 --> 19:53.338
D-rank?

19:53.922 --> 19:56.716
He was definitely stronger
than an E-rank hunter like me.

19:58.259 --> 20:00.845
But he got killed in a blink of an eye.

20:01.721 --> 20:02.805
This is strange.

20:02.889 --> 20:04.724
Isn't this a D-rank dungeon?

20:04.807 --> 20:06.601
How could such a creature be here?

20:07.185 --> 20:09.270
If the statue can move...

20:09.354 --> 20:10.230
Could it be...

20:24.327 --> 20:28.039
I have been through
many life-and-death situations.

20:28.915 --> 20:32.919
I got separated from the team
and was attacked in my first raid mission.

20:33.002 --> 20:35.964
I was injured by an E-rank magic beast
and hospitalized for several weeks.

20:36.839 --> 20:39.759
I also almost starved to death
when I was trapped in a maze.

20:40.426 --> 20:42.762
Even a low-rank dungeon

20:42.845 --> 20:44.889
is a life-and-death mission for me.

20:45.974 --> 20:50.103
Hunters spend the money earned
from magic gems on buying more weapons,

20:50.186 --> 20:52.188
in order to defeat stronger magic beasts

20:52.272 --> 20:54.232
and get higher rewards.

20:55.024 --> 20:57.568
However, I have nothing more
than a cheap little knife.

20:57.652 --> 21:00.071
If it gets damaged, I have to face
the magic beast bare-handed.

21:02.573 --> 21:04.534
These shoes are also worn out.

21:05.493 --> 21:08.246
And it goes on and on.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.418
I endure the ridicule of others.

21:13.501 --> 21:16.129
I do this dangerous job
that doesn't earn much.

21:16.963 --> 21:19.382
In order to survive, I must
constantly look for loopholes.

21:19.465 --> 21:21.509
I have to carefully observe
everything around me.

21:22.927 --> 21:23.928
Maybe that's why

21:24.595 --> 21:25.596
I know so well...

21:26.097 --> 21:27.265
Get down!

21:42.363 --> 21:43.865
Is this a joke?

21:43.948 --> 21:44.824
How could this happen?

21:44.907 --> 21:45.825
What happened?

21:45.908 --> 21:46.743
How would I know?

21:46.826 --> 21:48.953
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

21:49.037 --> 21:50.496
And you?

21:50.580 --> 21:51.664
I'm fine too.

21:51.748 --> 21:54.375
Don't...

21:54.959 --> 21:57.337
What happened?

21:58.254 --> 22:00.048
How did it end up like this?

22:00.715 --> 22:03.009
We're trapped, and there's no way out.

22:03.092 --> 22:05.470
I'm going to die.

22:09.057 --> 22:10.350
I'll be killed.
